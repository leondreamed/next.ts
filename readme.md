# Next.ts

Next.ts is an opinionated template for Next.js projects that comes with extreme type-safety for both routes and database operations (built on top of [Prisma](https://prisma.io)).

This template was used for use at [Dialect](https://dialect.so) to dramatically increase development speed using TypeScript's powerful intellisense and type-safety.

> Unfortunately, I have no intention on maintaining this template because I'm focused on working on my startup, Dialect (<https://dialect.so>), a platform that provides debugging help from experienced developers. However, I've open-sourced it so that other developers might find inspiration from it to add more type-safety into their projects :)
